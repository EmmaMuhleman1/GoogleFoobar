This is my submission to the Google Foobar challenge. If you are curious about the Foobar challenge read the blog post here.


⚠️ Warning ⚠️
This repo contains questions and solutions to the google Foobar challenge.

**Note:**
I contemplated not posting the article because I didn't want to "ruin" the challenge by making the solutions publicly accessible. However, they are anyway. A couple of people have already written about the problems and the solutions can be found on the internet. Additionally, I had a lot of fun going through the problems and realized that some of the algorithms could actually be applied to real-life problems I had before.
